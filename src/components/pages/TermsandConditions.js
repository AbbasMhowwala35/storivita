                            NAUMS Private Limited is solely an intermediary, connecting buyers and sellers. It does not
                            offer any logistics, warehousing, or delivery services. Delivery of goods is entirely the
                            responsibility of the Seller. Goods and services that are illegal under Indian law (such as
                            drugs, weapons, and related substances) are strictly prohibited from being listed or
                            transacted via STORIVITA.

                            such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Services
                            from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance
                            with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

                            <li>Upon dispatch, Sellers are responsible for delivering products directly to the Buyer.</li>
                            <li>At the time of delivery, the Buyer will provide the Seller or the Delivery Agent with a
                                unique confirmation code generated by the platform.</li>
                            <li>The Seller must input this code through the STORIVITA platform or app to confirm
                                receipt of the product.</li>
                            <li>This code serves as proof of delivery and triggers the start of a 24-hour post-delivery
                                period.</li>
                            <li>Funds held in escrow will be released to the Seller 24 hours after the Buyer confirms
                                delivery using the provided code, unless the Buyer submits a return or refund request
                                via the platform within this window.</li>

                                investigate by consulting both the Buyer and Seller.</li>
                            <li>If the claim is found valid, STORIVITA may facilitate a full or partial refund or propose
                                an alternative resolution in alignment with the Seller's policy and company
                                guidelines.</li>
                            <li>If no valid claim is raised within 24 hours after code-confirmed delivery, escrowed
                                funds are automatically and irreversibly released to the Seller.</li>
                            <li>After this, the Buyer must rely on the Seller's own published return/refund policy for
                                any further requests; STORIVITA will not intervene beyond this time frame.</li>
